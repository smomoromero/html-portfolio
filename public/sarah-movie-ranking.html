<h1>The Best Kids Movies according to Sarah Momo</h1>

<h2>My Top 4 Kid Movies (most recent)</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Coco</h3>
    <p>We watched this recently and it never fails to entertain.</p>

<h3>Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile</h3>
    <p>Recommended by Shazi. The kids loved it, and the crocodile is voiced by Shawn Mendes, so great movie soundtrack as well!</p>

<h3>The Nightmare Before Christmas</h3>
    <p>I will always love this movie for Halloween. I can't wait until the kiddos are old enough to watch this with me. </p>

<h3>Inside Out</h3>
    <p>Both movies are great! They represent human emotions in such a fun and unique way.</p>
