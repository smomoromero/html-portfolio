<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! My name is Sarah Momo Romero. I am just starting on this Web Developer journey, but I've been tech-savvy for a pretty long time.</p>

<p>I've worked as a graphic designer, a UX Designer, a digital illustrator and web designer, to name a few. Now, I've decided to branch out
  and follow my interests in web and app development to see what new and exciting opportunities await!
</p>

<p>I live in Los Angeles, California, in the lovely area of Atwater Village with my husband, two rambuntious little boys and a nutty mutt named Peanut.</p>
